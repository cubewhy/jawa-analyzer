Extreme fast Java LSP, built in Rust

## Archived

Update: I'm currently trying to rewrite everything inside the LSP. New updates will be received at the `next` branch

The current architecture design is completely flawed. I believe using a handwritten parser + rowan + salsa would be a better approach. Tree-sitter imposes too many limitations. I simply don't have the bandwidth to refactor it, so I'm archiving the repository.

If you got interest, please contact me, we could restart the project together.

My contacts can be found at my GitHub profile.
